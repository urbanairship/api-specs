        "description": "[Standard request filters](#schemas-eventsrequestfilters) check specific, predefined fields in your events and remove any events that don't match the criteria for that field. For example, the `device_types` filter always checks the `device_type` sub-field of the device object. In contrast, you can use JSON Predicates to examine any part of an event, providing more flexibility than the standard filters. You can also combine multiple JSON Predicate objects to create complex filtering logic for your event stream.\n\nThe simplest JSON Predicate examines a single key and provides a `matcher` object that can be applied to the value at that key. To filter a stream for only [Open events](#schemas-open), you could use the standard filter [`types`](#schemas-eventsrequestfilters-items-types): `filters:{\"types\": [\"OPEN\"]}`. However, to achieve this with a JSON Predicate, you would use `filters:{\"predicates\":{\"key\":\"type\", \"value\": {\"equals\": \"OPEN\"}}}`. This checks the value of the top-level key `type` to see if it's exactly \"OPEN\". It also serves as a foundational step for constructing more intricate filters.\n\nTo filter for only Android events, you could use the `device_type` filter, but a JSON Predicate allows for more complex combinations later. Since the device type key doesn't appear at the top level of the event, you'll need to provide a scope, like this `filters:{\"predicates\":{\"scope\":[\"device\"], \"key\":\"device_type\", \"value\": {\"equals\": \"ANDROID\"}}}`. This configuration targets the `device_type` key within the `device` object, checking if its value is \"ANDROID\".\n\nYou can combine the two filters to see only Opens from Android devices: `filters:{\"predicates\":{\"and\":[\n    {\"scope\":[\"device\"], \"key\":\"device_type\", \"value\": {\"equals\": \"ANDROID\"}},\n    {\"key\":\"type\", \"value\": {\"equals\": \"OPEN\"}}\n]}}`\n\nWe also have matchers other than `equals`. Numeric `at_least` and `at_most` can be combined to create ranges. `version_matches` uses [Ivy syntax](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.1.0/settings/version-matchers.html) to match version numbers. `is_present` determines if there's any value at a given key. `array_contains` can be combined with another predicate to determine if an array contains an object that matches another criteria.\n\n",

The accept header should be set to `application/vnd.urbanairship+x-ndjson; version=3;`. Each event contains an offset that denotes its location on the stream. If a client disconnects for any reason, it should reconnect with instructions to start at the last offset it successfully processed, to avoid missing any data. For each app key authorized to use Real-Time Data Streaming, Airship stores 7 days or 100 GB worth of data, whichever comes first.\n",

Each non-empty line in the response represents a single event.\n\nThis response body is of arbitrarily large size. As long as the connection is open, Airship will continue to write to the data stream. If no events have been dispatched down a connection for some time, the API will write to the connection to prevent it from being closed for inactivity. By default, only a blank line (a single newline character) will be written. If the `enable_offset_updates` field in the request is `true`, then instead of a blank line, an event will be written with type `OFFSET_UPDATE`. These events have no `body` or `device` field, and always have `occurred` and `processed` times indicating when they were sent. The `offset` field will contain the offset of the last event considered for inclusion in the stream whether or not it was actually sent. This may be useful to track position in the stream when using a filter which removes much of it.\n\n\nThese events should not be stored, and will be different for every connection even if requests are identical. `OFFSET_UPDATE` events are not subject to filters, and if requested will be delivered regardless of those specified. You should always check the type field before handling any delivered event.\n\n\nIf you receive no data or new line characters for ninety seconds, close the connection and reconnect.\n"

Each non-empty line in the response represents a single compliance event. Unlike events in a normal event stream, this endpoint returns events of the `compliance` type, and is open to SMS and email customers. As long as the connection is open, Airship will continue to write to the event stream.\n\nIf a stream records no events for a period of time, the API will write a blank line (a single newline character) to the connection to prevent it from being closed for inactivity. If the `enable_offset_updates` field in the request is `true`, then the blank line is replaced with an `OFFSET_UPDATE` event. These events have no `body` or `device` field, and always have `occurred` and `processed` times indicating when they were sent. The `offset` field will contain the offset of the last event considered for inclusion in the stream whether or not it was actually sent. This may be useful to track position in the stream when using a filter which removes much of it.\n\nYou should not store these events; they will be different for every connection even if requests are identical. `OFFSET_UPDATE` events are not subject to filters, and are delivered even if not specified in the list of events you want to return. You should always check the type field before handling any delivered event.\n\nIf you do not receive data or new line characters for ninety seconds, close the connection and reconnect.\n"
