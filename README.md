# Airship API Specs

This repository contains OpenAPI specs for public-facing Airship APIs.

## What the contents are for

We use these specs internally to generate our [API documentation](https://docs.airship.com/api/), but they can be used for other purposes such as payload validation, API client automation using tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/airship-api), or even the creation of mock servers. For more information about the OpenAPI specification and available tooling, see:

* [OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)
* [OpenAPI Tools Aggregator](https://openapi.tools/)

## Format and idiosyncracies

Specs are provided in both JSON and YAML format, and currently target OpenAPI 3.0. We have added a few extensions you may encounter while reading the specs, such as `x-note`, which facilitates our documentation generation. Any such extension can be safely ignored and should not impact the spec's usability.

## Feedback and Contribution

We welcome your feedback! While we cannot guarantee their correctness, our aim is to make these specs as correct and as helpful to developers as possible. If you have any bugs to report or suggestions for improvement to the specs as written, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/urbanairship/api-specs/issues). For broader feedback, you can also [email the Docs team](mailto:docs@airship.com).

The specs are currently autogenerated from content that lives in a separate private repo, so this means we are unable to accept direct pull requests here. However if you suggest a change or bug fix and it is approved, a member of our team can make the change upstream and release it.

Please keep in mind that this is not a technical support resource. For support, see the [Airship Support](https://support.airship.com/) page or [email the Support team](mailto:support@airship.com).
