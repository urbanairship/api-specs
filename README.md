# Airship API Specs

This repository contains Open API specs for public-facing Airship APIs.

## What the contents are for

We use these specs internally to generate our [API documentation](https://docs.airship.com/api/), but they can be used for other purposes such as payload validation, API client automation using tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or even the creation of mock servers. For more information about the Open API specification and available tooling, see:

* [Open API Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)
* [Open API Tools Aggregator](https://openapi.tools/)

## Format and idiosyncracies

Specs are provided in both JSON and YAML format, and currently target OpenAPI 3.0. We have added a few extensions you may encounter while reading the specs, such as `x-note`, which facilitates our documentation generation. Any such extension can be safely ignored and should not impact the spec's usability.

## Feedback and Contribution

We welcome your feedback! While we cannot guarantee their correctness, our aim is to make these specs as correct and as helpful to developers as possible. If you have any issues or suggestions for improvment, please let us know.

The specs are currently autogenerated from content that lives in a separate private repo, so this means we are unable to accept direct pull requests here. However if you suggest a change or bug fix and it is approved, a member of our team can make the change upstream and release it.
